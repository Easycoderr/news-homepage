# News Homepage

This project is a **UI-only rebuild of a modern news homepage layout**, created to practice **Tailwind CSS**, layout decisions, and responsive design — without relying on tutorials or UI libraries.

The goal was not to be pixel-perfect, but to **think like a frontend developer**:
breaking the layout into sections, choosing between Grid and Flex correctly, and building a clean, readable interface that works across screen sizes.

---

## ✨ What this project focuses on

- Tailwind CSS utility-first workflow
- Grid vs Flexbox layout decisions
- Responsive design (mobile → desktop)
- Typography hierarchy and spacing rhythm
- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Simple interactive behavior (mobile menu)

This is intentionally **not** a full product or app — it’s a focused learning project.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (CDN)
- Google Fonts (Inter)
- Minimal JavaScript (for mobile navigation toggle)

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout adapts for:

- Mobile screens (stacked layout, hamburger menu)
- Tablet screens
- Large desktop screens

Images and sections reorganize naturally using Tailwind breakpoints.
